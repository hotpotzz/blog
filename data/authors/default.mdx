I am Hotpotzz. A front-end developer from China, I previously worked at a major company in Beijing and now work at a small startup in Wuhan. My current job involves providing project consulting services and technical support to both businesses and individuals.

I am relentlessly dedicated to absorbing new knowledge and have organized my learning experiences and technical insights into projects and blog articles. This not only deepens my own understanding but also provides valuable references for my peers and beginners. When they explore the same technical fields, they can draw inspiration and guidance from my projects or articles. By sharing my knowledge and experience, I hope to help others grow and contribute to the entire tech community, which is of great importance to me.
